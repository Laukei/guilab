      <p>Taking data is the core function of I-V Tester. It assumes you have access to a <strong>Stanford Research Systems SIM900</strong> with <strong>SIM928</strong> voltage source and <strong>SIM970</strong> voltmeter modules. Optionally, a <strong>SIM922</strong> temperature module may be used to automatically include the temperature of your system. For each of the <strong>SIM922</strong> amd <strong>SIM970</strong> modules, the channels used must be specified. For more information see <a href="#settings">Settings</a>.</p>

      <p>With these modules attached, I-V Tester can automatically record the current-voltage characteristics of a superconducting nanowire single photon detector. At a bare minimum, the program must know the <strong>maximum voltage</strong> and <strong>step size</strong> in volts. It will then calculate the number of steps required to scan this range. Other fields are optional or automatically populated. The full range of fields is as follows, with <span class='text-info'>blue indicating the value may be autopopulated</span> and <span class='text-success'>green indicating the value is mandatory to run</span>.</p>

      <p>Once acceptable values have been input, the green "Run" button on the toolbar will begin the measurement. If the measurement needs to be aborted, the red "Halt" button (which illuminates when running a measurement) will allow this.</p>

      <p>Once the data has been acquired (or during the measurement with partial data), the data may be passed to the I-V Plotter tool by clicking the <strong>Plot</strong> button in the toolbar. Data will still continue to be taken if the measurement is not finished, though the Plotter will not update with it. For more information see <a href="#plotting">Plotting data</a>.</p>

      <p><strong class="text-danger">Data acquired through the I-V Tester is not automatically saved</strong>. However, the program will not exit without prompting to save. The data is saved in a text format, storing all of the settings from the program first, followed by the data shown in the preview window in X, Y format.</p>

      <p>If, after taking a dataset, further data is to be obtained from a similar setup, the <strong>New (sequential)</strong> option may be used from the <strong>File</strong> menu. This preserves the settings used previously, but scraps the acquired data.</p>

      <p>Data may be loaded into the program using the <strong>Open</strong> option from the <strong>File</strong> menu. The data may then be amended or passed to the Plotter. Finally, the raw data from the acquisition may be copied to the clipboard by pressing the <strong>Export</strong> button.</p>

        <p class="text-center">The I-V Plotter GUI</p>
      </div>
      <p>The I-V Plotter is designed to allow rapid, publication-quality, customisable plotting of current-voltage characteristics of a device. The Plotter includes a circuit model, and can calculate the current over the device from this. The Plotter loads its defaults from the I-V Tester's <a href="#settings">Settings</a>.</p>

      <p>The Plotter is comprised of a preview pane on the left-hand side and the control pane on the right-hand side. The preview is the image that is saved when the <strong>Export</strong> button, bottom right, is pressed. The control pane values can be returned to the defaults by pressing <strong>Reset</strong>. The Plotter may be closed unceremoniously by pressing <strong>Close</strong>.</p>

      <p>Many of the options in the control pane are self-explanatory. <strong>Graph title</strong> adds a graph title: a title is suggested automatically, but may be customised using the <strong>Title</strong> box, which accepts some LaTeX between $ signs (for example, Greek letters). Offsets in the supplied and measured voltages may be reset to zero using the <strong>Correct X offset</strong> and <strong>Correct Y offset</strong> checkbox. The metadata may be displayed on the plot by checking <strong>Verbose graph</strong>, and the axes may be manually defined using pairs of min/max values by checking <strong>Manual axes</strong>. Major gridlines may be added to the plot by checking <strong>Axis gridlines</strong>.</p>

        <p class="text-center">The circuit model calculated when <em>Supplied voltage vs device current</em> is checked</p>
      </div>

      <p>The internal circuit model is used when the <strong>Supplied voltage vs device current</strong> box is checked. In this model, the device current is calculated as <var>I<sub>device</sub></var> = (( <var>V<sub>source</sub></var> -  <var>V</var> ) / <var>R<sub>bias</sub></var> ) - ( V / <var>R<sub>shunt</sub></var> ). Plotter uses Python's <samp>float('inf')</samp> to simulate the system where there is no <var>R<sub>shunt</sub></var>. This models the behaviour when a superconducting device becomes resistive and the bulk of the current travels through the shunt resistor. This allows rapid and accurate determining of the the critical current of a superconducting device.</p>

      <p>Finally, the export settings set the <strong>Width</strong> and <strong>Height</strong> of the plot, and <strong>DPI</strong> the dots-per-inch resolution. The units for the width and height may be converted to centimetres (cm) or pixels (px) if these are more helpful.</p>

      <p>All of the control pane values are reset to defaults when the Plotter is closed.</p>

      <p>The <a href="#device">Device settings</a> and <a href="#plot">Plot settings</a> for the I-V Tester are accessed from the <strong>Settings</strong> menu. They are preserved between sessions, and are saved to disk on close.</p>

      <p>I-V Tester's <strong>device settings</strong> are absolutely vital and core to the operation of the system. <strong class='text-danger'>The program will behave in horrible and unexpected ways if these settings are wrong</strong>.
